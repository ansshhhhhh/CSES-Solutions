## Overview

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/), a fantastic collection of competitive programming problems. The solutions are written in **C++**.

The main purpose of this repository is to track my progress, document my solutions, and serve as a personal reference for algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure

The solutions are organized into folders that correspond to the categories on the CSES website:

* **/IntroductoryProblems**: Solutions to the introductory problems.
* **/SearchingAndSorting**: Solutions related to searching and sorting algorithms.
* **/DynamicProgramming**: Solutions based on dynamic programming techniques.
* **/GraphAlgorithms**: Solutions for graph-related problems.
* *(...and other categories as they are added)*

Each file within these folders is named according to the specific problem it solves.

## About the CSES Problem Set

The CSES Problem Set (CSES - Competitive Programmer's Handbook) is a popular online platform and book that provides a curated set of problems for learning and practicing competitive programming. The problems are divided into sections, each focusing on a different topic, which allows for a structured learning path.

## Disclaimer

These solutions represent my own approach to solving these problems. While they are intended to be correct and efficient, they are primarily for educational and personal documentation purposes. There may be multiple ways to solve each problem, and these solutions are just one of them.
